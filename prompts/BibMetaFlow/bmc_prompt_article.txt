Step 1: Create a JSON object containing bibliographic metadata of a scientific paper, extracted from a provided image, text, PDF file, or URL.

The JSON object should include the following fields:

- title: The title of the paper.
- title_english: The English translation of the paper's title.
- language: The ISO 639-1 language code (e.g., "en", "cs") identifying the primary language in which the paper is written.
- authors: An array of author objects, where each object contains:
	- name: The author's full name.
	- affiliation (Optional): The author's institutional affiliations, exactly as it appears in the text. There can be multiple affiliations for each author.
- abstract_czech (Optional): The complete abstract in Czech, extracted from the "Abstrakt" or "Souhrn" section.
- abstract_english (Optional): The complete abstract in English, extracted from the "Abstract" or "Summary" section.
- keywords_english (Optional): An array of English keywords.
- keywords_czech (Optional): An array of Czech keywords.
- DOI (Optional): The Digital Object Identifier of the paper.
- address (Optional): The corresponding author's institutional address.
- grant_information (Optional): The full funding information.
- grant_identifiers (Optional): Only the grant numbers.
- submission_date (Optional): The date the paper was submitted (format YYYY-MM-DD).
- acceptance_date (Optional): The date the paper was accepted (format YYYY-MM-DD).
- journal_info: An object containing details about the journal:
	- title: The full journal name.
	- title_short: The abbreviated journal name.
	- issn: The ISSN of the journal.
	- year: The publication year.
	- volume: The journal volume number.
	- issue: The journal issue number.
	- start_page: The starting page number of the article.
	- end_page: The ending page number of the article.

If any field is not explicitly available, search for the article's DOI online to find this information.

If the DOI is available:
- Use the Crossref API to validate the extracted journal metadata before the final output.
- Fetch the PubMed ID using the DOI and include it in a field named "pubmed".

Constraints for the json object creation:
- Do not modify the extracted items. Use them exactly as they appear in the source text, image, or file.
- Do not fabricate or infer any missing information or item.
- Do not translate titles or abstracts into English.
- Extract ISSN and DOI only if explicitly present in the document.
- Normalize only values in titles, author names, and journal fields to standard capitalization (e.g., title case). Do not modify casing otherwise.
- Do not output any reasoning - only the final JSON.

Output Rules:
- Output only the final JSON (no explanations or reasoning).
- Fields must match exactly what is extracted from the source unless otherwise stated.
- Do not fabricate or infer missing information.
- Do not modify or add to the extracted keyword fields.
- Normalize fully upper-case fields as described (titles, author names, journal names).
- Replace any dashes with hyphen.
- Pretty print the JSON.

Output JSON object should follow this structure exactly (use null or empty arrays/strings for missing optional fields):

{
  "title": "string",
  "title_english": "string",
  "language": "string",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "affiliation": ["string"]
    }
  ],
  "abstract_czech": "string",
  "abstract_english": "string",
  "keywords_english": ["string"],
  "keywords_czech": ["string"],
  "doi": "string|null",
  "address": "string|null",
  "grant_information": "string|null",
  "grant_identifiers": ["string"]|null,
  "submission_date": "YYYY-MM-DD|null",
  "acceptance_date": "YYYY-MM-DD|null",
  "journal_info": {
    "title": "string",
    "title_short": "string",
    "issn": "string|null",
    "year": "string",
    "volume": "string",
    "issue": "string",
    "start_page": "string",
    "end_page": "string"
  },
  "pubmed": "string|null",
}

If the extracted metadata conflicts with metadata retrieved from Crossref using the DOI, report these discrepancies explicitly.

The input will be uploaded or text/URLs to be pasted in the next message.
