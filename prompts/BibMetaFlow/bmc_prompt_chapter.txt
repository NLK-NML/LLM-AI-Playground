Step 1: Create a JSON object containing bibliographic metadata of a chapter in a scientific monograph, extracted from a provided image, text, PDF file, or URL.

The JSON object should include the following fields:

- title: The title of the paper.
- title_english: The English translation of the chapter's title.
- language: The ISO 639-1 language code (e.g., "en", "cs") identifying the primary language in which the chapter is written.
- authors: An array of author objects, where each object contains:
	- name: The author's full name.
	- affiliation (Optional): The author's institutional affiliations, exactly as it appears in the text. There can be multiple affiliations for each author.
- abstract_czech (Optional): The complete abstract in Czech, extracted from the "Abstrakt" or "Souhrn" section.
- abstract_english (Optional): The complete abstract in English, extracted from the "Abstract" or "Summary" section.
- keywords_english (Optional): An array of English keywords.
- keywords_czech (Optional): An array of Czech keywords.
- DOI (Optional): The Digital Object Identifier of the chapter.
- address (Optional): The corresponding author's institutional address.
- grant_information (Optional): The full funding information.
- grant_identifiers (Optional): Only the grant numbers.
- source_info: An object containing details about the source publication - monograph:
	- title: The full publication name.
	- isbn: The ISBN of the publication.
	- year: The publication year.
	- start_page: The starting page number of the chapter.
	- end_page: The ending page number of the chapter.
	- DOI (Optional): The Digital Object Identifier of the source publication.

If any field is not explicitly available, search for the chapter's DOI online to find this information.

If the DOI of the chapter or the source monograph/publication is available:
- Use the Crossref API to validate the extracted journal metadata before the final output.

Constraints for the json object creation:
- Do not modify the extracted items. Use them exactly as they appear in the source text, image, or file.
- Extract ISSN and DOI only if explicitly present in the document.
- Do not fabricate or infer missing information.
- Normalize text by converting fully upper-case strings in titles, author names, and journal fields to standard capitalization (e.g., title case). Do not modify casing otherwise.
- Do not output any reasoning â€” only the final JSON.

Output Rules:
- Output only the final JSON (no explanations or reasoning).
- Fields must match exactly what is extracted from the source unless otherwise stated.
- Do not fabricate or infer missing information.
- Do not modify or add to the extracted keyword fields.
- Normalize fully upper-case fields as described (titles, author names, journal names).
- Replace any dashes with hyphen.
- Pretty print the JSON.

Output JSON object should follow this structure exactly (use null or empty arrays/strings for missing optional fields):

{
  "title": "string",
  "title_english": "string",
  "language": "string",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "affiliation": ["string"]
    }
  ],
  "abstract_czech": "string",
  "abstract_english": "string",
  "keywords_english": ["string"],
  "keywords_czech": ["string"],
  "doi": "string|null",
  "address": "string|null",
  "grant_information": "string|null",
  "grant_identifiers": ["string"]|null,
  "source_info": {
    "title": "string",
    "isbn": "string|null",
    "year": "string",
    "start_page": "string",
    "end_page": "string"
  }
}

If the extracted metadata conflicts with metadata retrieved from Crossref using the DOI, report these discrepancies explicitly.

The chapters will be uploaded or text/URLs to be pasted in the next message.
