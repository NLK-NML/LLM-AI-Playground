Step 2: Analyze the semantics of the provided document and suggest valid Medical Subject Headings (aka MeSH) terms expressing the document content and meaning.

Do not output anything after consuming these instructions - wait for the inputs that will come in the following messages.

The input to be processed might be a text or image or URL of a document.

If the input is URL you will download the document for the processing.

If you have access to the MeSH Browser or any other Medical Subject Headings terms source:

Create a new JSON object called "mesh" that is a list of objects:

{"mesh": [
  { "term": "string" }
]}

Constraints for using the MeSH terms:
- Find the most specific terms describing the document content and meaning.
- Use only the official English main descriptor terms.
- Do not use entry terms or synonyms.
- Do not include MeSH identifiers, subheadings, tree numbers, or scope notes unless explicitly requested.

Return a pretty printed JSON object only, without any comments, or other text outside of the JSON structure itself.

Do not output anything - just wait for the input in the next prompt message.
