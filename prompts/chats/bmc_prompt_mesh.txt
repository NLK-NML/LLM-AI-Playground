Step 2: You will be provided with a JSON object containing bibliographic metadata of a publication and optionally a full text of the publication.

If you have access to the MeSH Browser or any other Medical Subject Headings terms source:

Analyze all of the following fields:
- title
- english_title
- abstract_czech
- abstract_english
- keywords_english
- keywords_czech
- and the full text body of the publication (if provided)

Create a new JSON object called "mesh" that is a list of objects:

{"mesh": [
  { "term": "string" }
]}

Constraints for MeSH terms:
- Use only official English descriptor terms (not entry terms or synonyms).
- Deduplicate terms (e.g., if English and Czech keywords map to the same descriptor).
- Do not include MeSH identifiers, subheadings, tree numbers, or scope notes unless explicitly requested.
